For musical chairs problem, the chair competing problem, N Persons Competing M Chairs in a round, each person must win at least W times in R consecutive rounds. 

We what would the output be for justice and fairness, close to reality: the chairs might be renewed (like concert tickets) in each round, people run differently in speed and might not need to wait for all others to start for next round, N and M might be very bigâ€¦

For compile file:
```
g++ -std=c++14 -o simulator main.cpp
```

For run code:
```
// Usage: N M R W
./simulator 100 20 500 5  
```
